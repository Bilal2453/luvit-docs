# Luvit Documentation

Much needed docs for luvit. 
The build system and scaffolding is straight up ripped out of node.js

You can make the docs with `make doc`

# Todo

- Add more code examples
- Expand on method/class/func defintions and their purposes
- Change code rendering from js to lua
- Rewrite doc generation pipe in lua/luvit?
