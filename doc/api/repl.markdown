# Repl

Implementation of a read-execute-print-loop in Luvit. Used by the Luvit repl which is returned when the Luvit binary is executed without args.  
Some of the examples/samples in these docs are generated by running luvit code in this repl.  
Additionally require names in the docs follow the ones automatically added into the repl during bootup (e.g. pretty-print is name-spaced as prettyPrint in the repl).  
All the luvit deps are injected into the repl at runtime to make it easier to try and experiment with the luvit ecosystem.
